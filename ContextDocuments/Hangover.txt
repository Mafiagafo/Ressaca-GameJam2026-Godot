The hangover is in the air!


Game overview
You control a commercial airline pilot attempting to complete simple maneuvers (takeoff, altitude hold, landing) while dealing with a severe hangover. The interface displays numerous buttons, levers, and instruments, but the hangover causes:


* Commands are executed incorrectly.
* Certain buttons may become temporarily unusable.
* The pilot himself may have memory lapses and confuse instructions.


The goal is to complete the "ideal flight checklist" knowing that, in practice, you will be prevented from doing everything correctly.


Everything Must Be:Complete all items on the mission checklist. (With a margin of error)
But not everything is possible:The control options don't always obey the player, or the player is prevented from choosing the best option at any given moment.


Game Loop principal
1. Briefing phase
   * The game presents the objectives of the phase (e.g., take off and stabilize at X feet, or perform an emergency landing).
   * You see the checklist of "perfect" actions (what should be done).
2. Execution under the tide
   * You try to follow the checklist in real time, but debuffs start to interfere:
      * Buttons stop responding.
      * Levers lock.
      * The interface displays conflicting or delayed instructions.
3. Consequence and evaluation
   * The game evaluates not only "whether or not the mission was completed," but also which rules/procedures you prioritized or sacrificed (safety, passenger comfort, fuel economy, etc.).
   * You unlock new "states" of hangover, new types of breakdowns, and new rules that are impossible to follow simultaneously.
Loop: Plan → Try to act correctly → Be sabotaged by debuffs → Adapt, decide what will be disregarded → See the impact.

Monitorable resources (briefing)
1. altitude
2. fuel_level
3. ETA (Airplane speed)
4. structural_hp (risk of damage/collapse)
5. passenger_comfort
6. company_pressure (deadlines, cost-cutting, reputation)


________________
Buttons and how they affect each feature.
1. Altitude
* Button: “Climb High”
   * Effect: Significantly increases altitude in this run, but consumes more fuel and increases stress on the structure.
* Button: “Smooth Ascent”
   * Effect: Increases altitude slightly, consumes less fuel, generates less stress, but may cause schedule delays (increases company pressure).
________________


2. Fuel
* Button: “Maximum Economy”
   * Effect: Reduces fuel consumption per trip, but limits top speed and makes controls less responsive (worsens comfort).
* Button: “Pull Power”
   * Effect: Increases fuel consumption to gain speed and/or altitude quickly, reducing lag, but increases stress on the structure.
________________


3. Speed
* Button: “Accelerate”
   * Effect: Increases speed, helps meet schedules and reduces company pressure, but consumes more fuel and may reduce comfort (more perceived turbulence).
* Button: “Reduce”
   * Effect: It slows down the process, improving comfort and reducing stress, but it can cause delays and increase company pressure.
________________


4. Structural stress
* Button: “Aggressive Maneuver”
   * Effect: Helps to quickly correct altitude/rotation, but significantly increases structural stress and passenger discomfort.
* Button: “Stabilize Structure”
   * Effect: Gradually reduces stress on the structure at the cost of limiting other actions in the round (e.g., cannot accelerate strongly).
________________


5. Passenger comfort
* Button: “Smooth Flight”
   * Effect: Prioritizes slow and smooth movements, reduces discomfort, but prevents certain abrupt actions (climbing hard, aggressive maneuvers) in this round.
* Button: "Calming Advertisement"
   * Effect: Temporarily reduces passenger discomfort/perception of danger, but consumes the pilot's "attention" (perhaps reducing their lucidity or leaving some indicator unsupervised during that round).
________________


6. Company pressure
* Button: "Keep to Schedule at Any Cost"
   * Effect: Reduces company pressure if you get closer to the ideal time, but increases fuel consumption and stress on the structure (unlocks more aggressive actions in that round).
* Button: “Report Delay / State Status”
   * Effect: It slightly increases passenger discomfort, but significantly reduces pressure on the airline (they "accept" the delay), allowing for safer decisions on subsequent flights without as much penalty.
________________
Visual references:
The idea is for it to be a resource management game, so all the information should be displayed on the plane's dashboard. We could perhaps include some visualization effects, but initially none would be necessary.
Perhaps something on the horizon, like a mountain or rain clouds.

Next steps:
1. Suggested Engine.
        Construct 2
        Other that the team is more comfortable using.
2. Required assets.
        6 sprites for the buttons and their "up and down" variations.
        6 meters to identify monitorable resources
        Assets ready for use as placeholders (to credit in the jam).
                Visual assets
                Sound effects assets
3. Desirable assets.
        Animations to indicate each event: (Turbulence, Pilot feeling unwell, rain, etc.)
        Our assets to add a personal touch to the game.
